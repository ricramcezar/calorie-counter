Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, I learned how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update my interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I learned and applied basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
